# CoViewer Flutter

This is a Flutter app that shows data and charts about the Covid 19 disease evolution in a majority of countries in the world.



## Getting Started


## API

I've used the Pomber/Covid19 Json time-series as the major API.
It can be found in https://github.com/pomber/covid19.
Thanks for making it available to all of us!
